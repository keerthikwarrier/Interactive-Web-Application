# Interactive-Web-Application
Creating an Interactive Web Application with Jupyter Notebook  

We will first create some interactive widgets using ipywidgets in a Jupyter notebook. Then, we will render the notebook as a web application using Voil√†. We will push the project onto a GitHub repository, and finally, host the web app on Binder.
